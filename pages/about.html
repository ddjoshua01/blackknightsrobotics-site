            <h1 class="rightheader">Team Overview</h1>
      
            <p>
                Team 2036 was founded in 2007 by three Fairview High School students passionate about technology and robotics. After having participated on other middle and high school robotics teams, they felt that there was no place for those interested in applying their continuously developing STEM skills at Fairview. And so, in the small desks of Room 420, with just one mentor and an inconsistent teacher sponsor, the students began researching FIRST and organized a club that has lead to today's Black Knights. We have migrated several times across the years. After Room 420, we shared Boulder High School’s machine shop with Team 1157, Landsharks, and later we shared a workshop at Fairview with the Technical Theater club, before finally finding our own space at the Solid State Depot, a local nonprofit makerspace and one of our primary sponsors.

                In 2007, our team had only 8 active members spread across Fairview and Boulder High. The team was small, but our enthusiasm for engineering was uncontainable, and in 2010 we won the Colorado Regional Tournament and competed at the World Championship in Atlanta. Despite this victory, our early years were not without their hiccups: our mentors and members were few and almost entirely inexperienced with FIRST, and in 2013 our robot caught on fire during the Colorado Regional. We quickly learned that competing in the FIRST Robotics Competition means being challenged. But more importantly, we learned, it means growing from the challenges we face. In 2013, we rose from the flames to rank 7th out of 48 teams, nearly finishing as semifinalists.

                The past few years have thrown historic challenges our way. In 2020, the Colorado Regional was canceled mere days in advance because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, the entire build season was canceled. Entering the 2022 season in many ways mirrored our rookie year, 2007. We had around 8 active members (most of whom were seniors), and all of them had been robbed of most FIRST experience for nearly two years. Both of our lead mentors had disappeared, and every member of our operations team had graduated without having the chance to properly train new members. We are grateful that our program survived the pandemic at all, however; two peer teams in Boulder were not so fortunate. Now, we are emerging from the ashes again.

            <h1 class="leftheader">About FIRST Robotics</h1>
      
            <p>
                FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science Technology) Robotics is a national competition where high school teams build and program 120-pound robots from scratch during a six week period. Each year, FIRST unveils a brand-new game, complete with unique challenges, and teams like ours must design a robot to excel in this ever-evolving playing field, combining the thrill of a sporting event with cutting-edge technology. This competition inspires young adults to pursue careers in engineering, computer science, mathematics, and many other STEM fields. It also gives its participants valuable, real-life leadership skills, communication skills, and self-confidence. By participating in FIRST Robotics, we hope to provide these opportunities to our students here on the team. For more information on FIRST Robotics, visit https://www.firstinspires.org/.

            <h1 class="rightheader">Meetings & Schedules</h1>
      
            <p>
                During the first semester, we meet every week at Fairview High School on Tuesdays from 4:00-5:00 PM, as well as Thursdays from 5:00-7:30 and Saturdays from 11:00-3:00 at the Solid State Depot in Boulder. <br> Then, for the eleven weeks of our Build Season between January and March, we meet at the Solid State Depot between from 5:30–9:00 PM on Mondays and Thursdays, 5:30–7:30 PM on Tuesdays, and 10:00 AM–4:00 PM on Saturdays. During Build Season, we design, construct, and program a robot to complete the challenge announced by FIRST every January. While you will learn more as a dedicated member of the team, we understand that people have other commitments, and it’s not essential to come to every meeting during the build season.

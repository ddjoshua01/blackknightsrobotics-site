            <p>
                We are Black Knights Robotics, a high school robotics team from the Boulder Valley School District and Solid State Depot in Boulder, Colorado. Our robotics team consists of a group of motivated students that have a passion for robotics and STEM. Our team participates in the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC), which gives us the opportunity to express ourselves through STEM and robotics, something that we don’t typically get the opportunity to do. By participating in this competition, we provide an outlet to motivated students to pursue their interests in math, science, technology, and engineering.

            <p>
                Our rookie season was in 2007, and since then, we have grown to become a very successful team. In 2010, we won Colorado regional event and attended the World Championship in Atlanta; in the 2017 Colorado regional competition, we won 6th place out of 50 teams from all across the United States; in 2022, we were 2nd place finalists at the Colorado regional and won 7th place out of 28 teams at the Kendrick Castillo Memorial Tournament in October. This year, we hope to compete at both the Colorado and Utah regional competitions, where we will try to qualify for Nationals!

                The great thing about how we structure our team is that it’s highly educational, completely student run, and fun for all of our team members. Inclusivity and diversity are hardwired into our team. The perceived difficulty of robotics can be intimidating for inexperienced individuals, so we work offer extensive training and work to create an inclusive, fun, and creatively active environment.

            <h1 class="leftheader">About FIRST Robotics</h1>
      
            <p>
                FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science Technology) Robotics is a national competition where high school teams build and program 120-pound robots from scratch during a six week period. This competition inspires young adults to pursue careers in engineering, computer science, mathematics, and many other STEM fields. It also gives its participants valuable, real-life leadership skills, communication skills, and self-confidence. By participating in FIRST Robotics, we hope to provide these opportunities to our students here on the team. For more information on FIRST Robotics, visit https://www.firstinspires.org/.

            <h1 class="rightheader">Meetings & Schedules</h1>
      
            <p>
                During the first semester, we meet every week at Fairview High School on Tuesdays from 4:00-5:00 PM. Then, for the eleven weeks of our Build Season between January and March, we meet at the Solid State Depot between from 5:30–9:00 PM on Mondays and Thursdays, 5:30–7:30 PM on Tuesdays, and 10:00 AM–4:00 PM on Saturdays. During Build Season, we design, construct, and program a robot to complete the challenge announced by FIRST every January. While you will learn more as a dedicated member of the team, we understand that people have other commitments, and it’s not essential to come to every meeting during the build season.
